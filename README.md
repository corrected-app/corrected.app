Elon Musk makes a lot of predictions about when his companies will bring stuff to market. He's reasonably consistent about delivering on his promises, too! Just... late. His predictions may contain telling information about when we can expect him to deliver something, it's just that his numbers are very often wrong. And because they're wrong in a biased way (he consistently predicts things will be ready sooner than they are), we can *correct* his predictions. For example, consider this tweet:

[![Pickup truck unveil in 18 to 24 months](https://corrected.app/img/TeslaSemi.png)](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/852581322451111936)

Here he is making a concrete prediction that Tesla will unveil a pickup truck in 18 to 24 months. Note that Musk made the tweet on 2017-04-13. 18 months later is 2018-10-13, and 24 months later is 2019-04-13. So, did Tesla unveil the pickup truck within the predicted window? [He teased, of course](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1106714774694297601/photo/1), but [it didn't get revealed until the following November](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-truck-livestream-elon-musk/).

This app takes a curated collection of Elon's delivery estimates and the times the things were actually delivered, and performs a simple linear regression to estimate how long deliveries actually take, based on Elon's estimate.
